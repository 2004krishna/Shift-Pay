Shift-Pay
I developed to simplify the way shift work is managed and how payments are calculated for workers. The idea came from seeing how complex and error–prone spreadsheets and manual calculations can get when shifts vary, rates change, and overtime needs to be tracked. Using this tool, organizations or team leads can easily input shifts, manage pay-rates, and let the system handle the heavy lifting of calculating total hours, overtime, and pay summaries.

In the background the app uses a clean UI based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and a structured logic layer that handles all the shifting, hours and pay logic. Because shifts often overlap, wages differ depending on time or day, or bonuses/penalties apply, the system is designed to flexibly support a variety of pay scenarios. This makes the whole process faster, more accurate, and transparent for both workers and managers.

For anyone ready to set it up, the repo includes everything you’ll need: simply clone the project, install any dependencies (if there are backend modules or build steps), run the web server (or open the front-end files), enter your shift data and pay rules, and the system will do the rest. The code is modular, so you can extend it—for example by adding user authentication, integrating with real payroll systems, or mobile support.

Overall, Shift-Pay is my response to a common pain point: managing shift-based payments in a reliable, scalable way. It reflects my interest in building tools that make everyday operations simpler and smarter. I hope this project can serve you or your team as a starting point, a utility you can adapt, or a foundation you can build upon.
